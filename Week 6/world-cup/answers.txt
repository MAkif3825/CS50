Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
 For 2018, there is no possibility to predict the championship of France, I guess. But the numbers are getting more stabilized after 10000 of simulations are done.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
 I think 10000 is a good number because it gives better outputs while it doesn't take a lot time.
