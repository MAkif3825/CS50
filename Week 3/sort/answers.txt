sort1 uses: Bubble

How do you know?: It was very fast in Sorted because there was nothing to change. But it was not as fast as others in reversed so I think it must be bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge

How do you know?: Because it was faster then others in random.

sort3 uses: Selection

How do you know?: Because it was very slow in sorted due to it's checking feature.
